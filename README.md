Mobile App Project Outline

Project Description

The mobile application is an Android-based habit, productivity, and wellness tracker. It enables users to organize daily tasks, build consistent habits, and monitor their mental well-being in one centralized platform. This app is meant to provide a structured system that supports productivity and personal wellness. This will help users gain insight into behavior patterns through mood logs, progress charts, and habit streaks. This will also encourage routine-building to reduce stress and improve focus.

Problem Being Addressed

Individuals often struggle to maintain productivity due to constant distractions, digital overload, and heavy workloads. Mental wellness is often overlooked because tools for tracking emotions and habits are spread across separate apps. This app combines habit tracking, task management, and mood monitoring into a single, easy-to-use interface. It will help users create consistent routines through reminders, scheduling tools, and visual progress indicators. This can also support mental clarity by allowing users to reflect on patterns over time.

Platform

The target Platform would include Android mobile devices. The development environment would include Android Studio using Java or Kotlin.

Front-End / Back-End Support

The front-end of the application will be developed using Android’s XML layout system, which allows for clean interface design and intuitive user interactions. This includes interactive components such as buttons, a navigation bar, date pickers, and input fields that support smooth and efficient user activity. The app will also incorporate graphical charts to display trends in mood and habit progress, giving users a visual understanding of their routines. On the back-end, the project will rely on Firebase services, using either the Realtime Database or Firestore to store user data securely. Firebase Authentication will provide protected login options, such as email/password or Google sign-in, ensuring user accounts remain secure. Additionally, cloud storage and syncing features will enable automatic backup and accessibility of user information across multiple devices.

Functionality

The functionality of the Habit & Wellness app centers on helping users build consistency and stay organized through a set of core features. The habit tracking tool allows users to create, edit, and delete habits while monitoring progress through streaks and visual indicators. Task management supports adding tasks with due dates and reminders, as well as organizing them by category or priority to keep daily responsibilities clear and manageable. The mood monitoring feature enables users to log how they feel each day, add personal notes, and view emotional trends over time to support mental wellness. In addition to these core components, the app includes helpful enhancements such as push notifications for reminders, a dashboard that summarizes daily progress, and cloud syncing so users can securely access their data across multiple devices.

Design (Wireframes)

The wireframes I created provide a clear visual outline of the main screens and user flow for the Habit & Wellness mobile application. The Home Dashboard screen includes a greeting, a count of completed tasks, and a progress bar showing goal completion, giving users a quick overview of their day. The Goals screen allows users to add new goals, choose whether they are daily or weekly, set due dates, and track how many goals have been completed. The Tasks screen displays a simple list of tasks with checkboxes and due dates, making it easy to stay organized. The Mood screen prompts the user to reflect on how they are feeling, add notes, and view mood trends over time. Each screen uses a consistent bottom navigation bar to include Home, Goals, Tasks, and Mood to ensure smooth movement through the app. These sketches effectively show the structure, layout, and interaction flow, and they serve as the foundation for the app’s design and development.
