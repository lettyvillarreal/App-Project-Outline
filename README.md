Mobile App Project Outline

Project Description

The mobile application is an Android-based habit, productivity, and wellness tracker. It enables users to organize daily tasks, build consistent habits, and monitor their mental well-being in one centralized platform. This app is meant to provide a structured system that supports productivity and personal wellness. This will help users gain insight into behavior patterns through mood logs, progress charts, and habit streaks. This will also encourage routine-building to reduce stress and improve focus.

Problem Being Addressed

Individuals often struggle to maintain productivity due to constant distractions, digital overload, and heavy workloads. Mental wellness is often overlooked because tools for tracking emotions and habits are spread across separate apps. This app combines habit tracking, task management, and mood monitoring into a single, easy-to-use interface. It will help users create consistent routines through reminders, scheduling tools, and visual progress indicators. This can also support mental clarity by allowing users to reflect on patterns over time.

Platform

The target Platform would include Android mobile devices. The development environment would include Android Studio using Java or Kotlin.

Front-End / Back-End Support

The front-end of the application will be developed using Android’s XML layout system, which allows for clean interface design and intuitive user interactions. This includes interactive components such as buttons, a navigation bar, date pickers, and input fields that support smooth and efficient user activity. The app will also incorporate graphical charts to display trends in mood and habit progress, giving users a visual understanding of their routines. On the back-end, the project will rely on Firebase services, using either the Realtime Database or Firestore to store user data securely. Firebase Authentication will provide protected login options, such as email/password or Google sign-in, ensuring user accounts remain secure. Additionally, cloud storage and syncing features will enable automatic backup and accessibility of user information across multiple devices.

Functionality

The functionality of the Habit & Wellness app centers on helping users build consistency and stay organized through a set of core features. The habit tracking tool allows users to create, edit, and delete habits while monitoring progress through streaks and visual indicators. Task management supports adding tasks with due dates and reminders, as well as organizing them by category or priority to keep daily responsibilities clear and manageable. The mood monitoring feature enables users to log how they feel each day, add personal notes, and view emotional trends over time to support mental wellness. In addition to these core components, the app includes helpful enhancements such as push notifications for reminders, a dashboard that summarizes daily progress, and cloud syncing so users can securely access their data across multiple devices.

Design (Wireframes)

The wireframes I created provide a clear visual outline of the main screens and user flow for the Habit & Wellness mobile application. The Home Dashboard screen includes a greeting, a count of completed tasks, and a progress bar showing goal completion, giving users a quick overview of their day. The Goals screen allows users to add new goals, choose whether they are daily or weekly, set due dates, and track how many goals have been completed. The Tasks screen displays a simple list of tasks with checkboxes and due dates, making it easy to stay organized. The Mood screen prompts the user to reflect on how they are feeling, add notes, and view mood trends over time. Each screen uses a consistent bottom navigation bar to include Home, Goals, Tasks, and Mood to ensure smooth movement through the app. These sketches effectively show the structure, layout, and interaction flow, and they serve as the foundation for the app’s design and development.

This can also support mental clarity by allowing users to reflect on patterns over time.

Platform

The app is being developed for Android mobile devices.
•	Development Environment: Android Studio
•	Languages: Java or Kotlin
•	Target Devices: Modern Android smartphones
•	Planned Setup:
o	Minimum SDK: mid-range Android version (to support more users)
o	Use of Android Jetpack components where appropriate (e.g., ViewModel, LiveData) in later versions

Front-End / Back-End Support

The front-end of the Habit & Wellness Tracker app will be developed using Android’s XML layout system to create clean, simple, and user-friendly screens. The interface will include essential UI elements such as buttons, input fields, checkboxes, and a bottom navigation bar to help users move easily between the Home, Habits, Tasks, and Mood sections. The design will also use progress indicators and simple charts to help users understand their routines, habit streaks, and mood patterns over time. These screens will follow a consistent visual layout, making the app feel intuitive and easy to navigate.
The back-end will rely on Firebase to ensure secure data storage and user authentication. Firebase Authentication will allow users to sign in using email and password or other available login methods, providing a secure way to access their information. User data, such as habits, tasks, and mood entries, will be stored in Firebase’s Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore, allowing information to sync across devices and remain available even if the user switches phones. As the app expands, Firebase Cloud Storage may also be used for saving additional data, such as user-generated notes or images. This back-end setup supports reliability, security, and seamless access to the user’s information.

Functionality

The Habit & Wellness Tracker app will include several core features designed to help users stay organized, build routines, and monitor their well-being. The habit-tracking feature will allow users to create personalized habits, mark them as complete, and view their overall progress through streaks or completion history. The task-management portion will let users add tasks with titles, descriptions, and due dates, giving them a clear overview of what needs to be accomplished throughout the day. Reminders and notifications will help users stay on schedule and avoid missing important responsibilities. The mood-tracking feature will allow users to record how they feel each day using simple mood options and optional notes, giving them a way to reflect on emotional patterns over time. All of these elements will come together on a centralized dashboard that provides a quick summary of daily tasks, habit progress, and mood entries, helping users understand their routines at a glance.

Design (Wireframes)

The design of the app is organized around a set of wireframes that outline the main screens and overall navigation flow. The Home Dashboard will provide a welcoming summary that shows the user’s daily progress, including habits completed, tasks due, and a quick link to log their mood for the day. The Goals or Habits screen will present a clear list of the user’s current habits with indicators showing completion status and the option to add new habits or edit existing ones. The Tasks screen will display upcoming and overdue tasks in a clean, scrollable layout with checkboxes, due dates, and the ability to prioritize or categorize items. The Mood screen will offer a simple and friendly interface that allows users to select their mood, add optional notes, and review previous entries through a history or chart view. All screens will share a consistent layout and will be connected by a bottom navigation bar, ensuring smooth movement between different parts of the app. These wireframes serve as the visual plan for how the user will interact with the app and will guide the development of the XML layouts in Android Studio.
